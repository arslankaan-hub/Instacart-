# Instacart grocery basket analysis
## Project Summary
This project focuses on analyzing customer purchasing behaviors at Instacart which is a leading online grocery delivery platform. While Instacart has already achieved strong sales performance, the company seeks deeper insights into its sales patterns to enhance decision-making and strategy development.

Through exploratory data analysis (EDA) and segmentation, the project aims to identify meaningful customer groups and uncover trends in order frequency, product preferences and shopping habits. The findings will serve as the foundation for targeted marketing strategies, helping Instacart tailor campaigns to specific customer profiles rather than applying a one-size-fits-all approach.

By addressing key stakeholder questions such as how customers differ in their purchasing behavior, which products drive loyalty, and how shopping frequency varies—the analysis provides actionable recommendations for improving engagement, increasing retention and boosting overall sales performance.
## Key questions
 ● What the busiest days of the week and hours of the day are (i.e., the days and times with the most orders) in order to schedule ads at times when there are fewer orders.
 
 ● Are there particular times of the day when people spend the most money, as this might inform the type of products Instacart advertise at these times.
 
 ● Instacart has a lot of products with different price tags. Marketing and sales want to use simpler price range groupings to help direct their efforts.
 
 ● Are there certain types of products that are more popular than others? 
 
 ● The marketing and sales teams are particularly interested in the different types of customers in their system and how their ordering behaviors differ. For example:
 
 ○ What’s the distribution among users in regards to their brand loyalty (i.e., how often do they return to Instacart)?
 
 ○ Are there differences in ordering habits based on a customer’s loyalty status?
 
 ○ Are there differences in ordering habits based on a customer’s region?
 
 ○ Is there aconnection between age and family status in terms of ordering habits?
 
 ○ What different classifications does the demographic information suggest? Age? Income? Certain types of goods? Family status?
 
 ○ What differences can you find in ordering habits of different customer profiles?
