# Instacart grocery analysis
## Project Summary
This project focuses on analyzing customer purchasing behaviors at Instacart which is a leading online grocery delivery platform. While Instacart has already achieved strong sales performance, the company seeks deeper insights into its sales patterns to enhance decision-making and strategy development.

Through exploratory data analysis (EDA) and segmentation, the project aims to identify meaningful customer groups and uncover trends in order frequency, product preferences and shopping habits. The findings will serve as the foundation for targeted marketing strategies, helping Instacart tailor campaigns to specific customer profiles rather than applying a one-size-fits-all approach.

By addressing key stakeholder questions such as how customers differ in their purchasing behavior, which products drive loyalty, and how shopping frequency variesâ€”the analysis provides actionable recommendations for improving engagement, increasing retention and boosting overall sales performance.
